# Format mapping for Vale
# This section tells Vale how to parse different file formats
# MDX (Markdown + JSX) files need special handling because they contain:
# - Standard Markdown syntax
# - JSX components and expressions
# - React imports
# By mapping "mdx = md", we tell Vale:
# "Treat .mdx files as if they were regular Markdown files"
# This allows Vale to:
# 1. Parse the Markdown content correctly
# 2. Ignore JSX-specific syntax (components, imports, expressions)
# 3. Apply Markdown-based rules to the prose content
# Without this mapping, Vale would not know how to handle .mdx files
# and would either skip them entirely or throw parsing errors
